These monkey bars are where I do pullups for exercise. The problem that I ran into was that sometimes kids would show up the park and would climb on the monkey bars like they were intended to be used. (I know, crazy right!) When kids were on the monkey bars, I could not do my pullups. This was totally fine, but I didn't want to trek out to the park only to have my eager mood ruined by the happy laughter of children on the monkey bars. I would have to turn around and walk back to my house. This inconvenience inspired my RoguePi project. #TODO
